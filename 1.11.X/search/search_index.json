You\u2019ll need to ensure that the TTPs in both platforms are aligned. For instance, if your report contains the TTP T1059.001, a scenario can be created with an inject, provided OpenBAS also includes T1059.001.</p> <p>When generating a scenario from OpenCTI, a scenario is created and can be accessed from the scenarios screen.

Additionally, you'll need to select appropriate targets for the injects within the scenario.</p> <p>Once you've finalized the scenario, you can schedule your simulation as you would do for any other scenarios. The overall results of the simulation will also be available directly within OpenCTI, providing insights into the threat context upon which the scenario is based.</p> <p></p>"}]}
