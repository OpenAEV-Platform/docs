# OpenBAS Agent

## Introduction

The OpenBAS Agent is an application whose main role is to enroll an Asset on the OpenBAS platform,
to retrieve jobs or scripts to be executed and to transmit this information to Implants (subject to come)
for execution on the host Asset.

The Agent will not perform direct actions on the Asset to remain neutral for antivirus and ensure the full run of the simulation.

The OpenBAS Agent is compatible with different OS (Windows, Linux, macOS) and is developed in Rust.

## Installation

Depending on the OS, several installations are at your disposal, you can find them on OpenBAS by clicking the blue icon on the right top corner :
![Agents](../administration/assets/agents.png)

!!! note

    Since the release 1.14, several OpenBAS agents can be installed on a machine to try different configurations on Payload executions:<br/>
    - Example 1: with the standard installation, you can install two agents on your machine with different privileges (one standard and one administrator).<br/>
    - Example 2: with the advanced installation as system (installation before release 1.14), you have installed an agent with system user and privileges. It could be interesting to install an agent from the standard installation to compare the behavior like folders accesses, environment variables, privileges,...<br/><br/>
    **For more details, see the explanations below for each OS and each installation.** 

Linux

- Requirement → systemd, access to the openbas instance used
- Compatibility → All systemd based linux distros

Windows

  - Requirement : 
    - Ensure access to the OpenBAS instance being used, 
    - Ensure that the system environment variable "Path" contains the values "%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\" and "%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\", 
    - For "Advanced installation as User (service)", you need to enable the "Service Logon" policy for the user you want to run the service as, follow [this tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/system-center/scsm/enable-service-log-on-sm?view=sc-sm-2025) to do it
  - Compatibility → All major Windows versions

!!! note

    If the installation fails, try using PowerShell 7 or higher.

The following flow diagram represents the Agent installation flow :

![img.png](../administration/assets/agent_installation_flow_diagram.png)

## Network Traffic

The installation creates two firewall rules.

Inbound rule
![Inbound rule](../administration/assets/inbound-rule.png)

Outbound rule
![Outbound rule](../administration/assets/outbound-rule.png)

## Features

The main features of the OpenBAS Agent are:

- Agent registration on the OpenBAS platform

  The Agent is installed on the Asset using an agent-installer.exe file and runs as a service.
  It communicates with the deployed OpenBAS instance in order to enroll the Asset. In some cases
  like unsecured certificates or environment with proxy, the agent can't communicate with OpenBAS.
  In order to fix those issues, look at "Network and security" chapter from [configuration](https://docs.openbas.io/latest/deployment/configuration)
  to add the required attributes.

  NB : An Asset can only have one OpenBAS agent installed thanks to a machine id calculated according
  to the operating system and its parameters. If you try to install again an OpenBAS agent on a platform, it will
  overwrite the actual one and you will always see one endpoint on the OpenBAS endpoint page.

![Agent assets status](../administration/assets/agent_assets_status.png)

- Auto upgrade the Agent (on start-up and registration)

- Retrieval of jobs to be executed

  The Agent retrieves jobs to be executed from the OpenBAS instance every 30 seconds.
  For the moment, jobs are Implant to spawn and launch on the Asset, waiting to execute payloads of your Simulation's Injects.
  Each job execution logs is kept in a dedicated directory in order to have a trace of what happened (pid, executable).

- Deleting executables and execution directories

  The Agent deletes Implants that have been running for a predefined time and cleans the execution directories.

- Health check

  The Agent pings the OpenBAS instance every 2 minutes to notify it of its healthy status.

- Cleanup

  The Agent ensures that the processes it has executed are correctly finished or deleted if necessary. 
  The maximum time in minutes that a process associated with an execution directory can remain active is 20 minutes.

  The Agent removes execution directories to avoid excessive disk space. 
  The maximum time in minutes that an execution directory can be kept before being deleted is 2 days.

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues with your agent, the logs are available here (see the "Installation" section above to get the folder path) :

- Linux -> [FOLDER_PATH]/openbas-agent.log
- MacOS -> [FOLDER_PATH]/openbas-agent.log
- Windows -> [FOLDER_PATH]\openbas-agent.log
