Lessons in OpenBAS enable you to create customizable surveys for your simulations. These surveys can be composed of
various categories and questions within those categories. This feature helps in conducting the often overlooked part of
a Breach and Attack Simulation involving real people, by automating the process and complementing your simulation
results with qualitative feedback.
