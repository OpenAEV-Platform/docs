After completing these steps, your new document will appear in the document list. Clicking on a document in the list
will allow you to download it.

## Use a Document

Documents can be added into table-top injects and payloads.

When creating an table-top inject, you can attach documents to provide context or, in the case of email injects, to
include attachments.

Additionally, you can create a File Drop payload and include your documents within it.
