# Challenges

Challenges are integral to handling CTF (Capture The Flag) activities on the OpenBAS platform. You can define your
challenge and the flags that need to be found to complete it.

## Create a Challenge

To create a new challenge, follow these steps:

1. Click the + button at the bottom right corner of the screen.
2. Give your new challenge a name and specify one or more flags.
3. Optionally, fill in additional fields to provide more context to your players, such as the category, content (
   explanation, context, steps), and attach any relevant documents.
4. Manage your challenge by setting a score and a maximum number of attempts allowed for completing the challenge.

Once completed, your new challenge will appear in the challenge list.

## Use a Challenge

Challenges can be utilized in Scenarios and Simulations. When creating an inject of type "Publish challenges," you need
to select a challenge to be sent to your players.
