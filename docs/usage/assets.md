## Endpoints

An endpoint is a terminal that can be connected to a network including desktops, laptops, mobile phones, tablets and
servers. The list of endpoints continues to grow and now includes less traditional items, such as printers, cameras,
electronic devices, smart watches, health tracking devices, navigation systems and other terminals that can be connected
to the Internet.

Examples of endpoints:

- **Computers**: This includes desktops, laptops, and servers within an organization's network.
- **Mobile Devices**: Smartphones and tablets that connect to the network are also considered endpoints.
- **Workstations**: Terminals or dedicated machines used by individuals to perform specific tasks or access network
  resources.
- **IoT Devices**: Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as smart thermostats, cameras, or sensors, can also be
  considered endpoints.

## Asset groups

An asset group refers to a collection or grouping of related assets within an organization. Asset groups typically share
common characteristics like platform or hostname pattern.
