As of today, OpenBAS has only one notification type: scenario score degradation. his alert emails you when a scenario's simulation score drops below the previous score of the previous run.

To enable the notification, open the scenario page and click this icon: ![Notification Icon](./assets/notification_icon.png).

 A popup lets you edit the email subject (**Trigger** and **Notifier** are currently fixed). The alert is sent to the email of the user who activates it.
