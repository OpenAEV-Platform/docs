# Custom dashboards

OpenBAS provides an adaptable and entirely customizable dashboard functionality. The flexibility of OpenBAS's dashboard
ensures a tailored and insightful visualization of data, fostering a comprehensive understanding of the platform's
live activity.

## List of custom dashboards

From the left menu, you can choose the custom dashboards option to see all the custom dashboards you have created.

**Actions panel**

You can realise actions on a dashboard using the button located at the end of each line:

- update
- delete

With the "+" button on the bottom right corner, you can create a custom dashboard.

The field "Parameters" is used for adding a dynamic parameter for the widgets. For now, only the param "simulation" is implemented.
It means that if you add this parameter to your dashboard, you can choose this parameter in your widget and the widget will be calculated according to the simulation you will have selected.
See [widgets](../widgets/widgets.md) or [simulations](../../simulation.md) for more details.

## Dashboard overview

You have the flexibility to tailor the arrangement of [widgets](../widgets/widgets.md) on your dashboard.
Widgets can be intuitively placed to highlight key information. Additionally, you can resize widgets from the bottom
right corner based on the importance of the information, enabling adaptation to specific analytical needs. This
technical flexibility ensures a fluid, visually optimized user experience.
