# OpenAEV encryption

!!! info ""

    * **Introduced in**: `OpenAEV 2.1.0`

## Description of changes

With the introduction of the composer catalog, built-in connectors are managed through the OpenAEV UI. Those connectors have their configuration saved in database.

For security reasons, the properties of type password need to be encrypted inside the database. This means that we need to introduce two new mandatory properties (as you can see here in the page dedicated to [configuration](../../configuration/#basic-parameters)) :

| Parameter                          | Environment variable               | Default value         | Description                                                                                                              |

| openaev.admin.encryption_key       | OPENAEV_ADMIN_ENCRYPTION_KEY       | ChangeMe              | Encryption key used for encrypting sensitive data in database. Encryption key and salt are used to generate a 256bit encryption key for encrypting purpose.                                |
