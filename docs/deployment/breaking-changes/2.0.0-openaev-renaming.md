# OpenAEV renaming

!!! info ""

    * **Deprecated in**: `OpenBAS 1.18.20`
    * **Removed in**: `OpenAEV 2.0.0`

## Description of changes

A lot of processes have been automated, but there are still little changes to do manually.

**OpenAEV namespace renaming**

All our Docker images have been moved to a new namespace. If you're using one of them, be careful to load them from the new [Docker repository](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=openaev)

**OpenAEV Configuration migration**

Check configuration consistency for SAML and global variables if used on your platform properties.

**CrowdStrike Response Scripts renaming**

Check configuration consistency for CrowdStrike if used on your platform properties.

**Agent updates**

Agent folders on Assets are automatically updated from OpenBAS to OpenAEV, except for agents installed in Advanced installation as User (service).

To avoid losing any data, the attack logs and execution files have not been deleted and are preserved in the old OpenBAS agent folder.
During the reinstallation of the new OpenAEV agent, a new agent is created on OpenAEV, rendering the old OpenBAS agents obsolete.


## Migration guide

**OpenAEV namespace renaming**

- If you're using our official [docker compose](https://github.com/OpenAEV-Platform/docker), be sure to use the platform image from the new OpenAEV Docker repository.

**OpenAEV Configuration migration**

- It should be automatic, but if you have any issue at startup, check if you are well synced with all new variables into the [documentation](../../deployment/configuration.md).
- If you use the SAML, be careful with the renaming variable names from OPENBAS_PROVIDER_XXX, to OPENAEV_PROVIDER_XXX. You can find more details on the [documentation](../../deployment/authentication.md).

**CrowdStrike Response Scripts renaming**

- If you use CrowdStrike Agents, be careful with the renaming variable response script names from "OpenBAS Subprocessor (XXX)"
  , to "OpenAEV Subprocessor (XXX)". You can find more details on the [documentation](../../deployment/ecosystem/executors.md#crowdstrike-falcon-agent).

**Agent updates**

!!! warning

    These tasks are only to be performed for agents installed in Advanced installation as User (service).

- Follow this [link](../../usage/openbas-agent.md) to uninstall (follow the instruction at the end of your operating system table) your OpenBAS Agent, and to install the new OpenAEV Agent.
