#### OpenAEV renaming

Following the evolution of scope in OpenBAS (Open Breach & Attack Simulation), it was decided to rename the project to OpenAEV (Open Adversarial Exposure Validation).

This platform allows you to entirely create custom attack scenarios to emulate on endpoints. You can even create your own automated tabletop crisis simulation.

All those changes require manual modifications to upgrade from previous versions of OpenBAS, even if a lot have been automated.

Take note that the first startup can be longer, all modifications have to be applied, and it can take a bit longer than usual.

#### OpenAEV SCV

Following the evolution of scope in OpenAEV (Open Adversarial Exposure Validation), it was decided to decided to add a layer of Security Control Validation.

They help users understand which defensive capability is being evaluated and allow scenarios and payloads to be interpreted with clearer operational intent.
