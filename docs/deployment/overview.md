# Overview

Before starting the installation, let's discover how OpenEx is working, which dependencies are needed and what are the minimal requirements to deploy it in production.

## Architecture

The OpenEx platform relies on several external databases and services in order to work.

### Platform

The platform is the central part of the OpenEx platform, allowing users to configure exercises and campaigns as well as systems and players.

### Injectors

All injectors are shipped within the platform but are not enabled by default. Injectors are used to interact with third-party applications and services such as social medias, cyber ranges, cybersecurity products, etc.

!!! note "List of connectors"

    You can find all currently available connector in the [OpenEx Ecosystem](https://filigran.notion.site/OpenEx-Ecosystem-30d8eb73d7d04611843e758ddef8941b).
