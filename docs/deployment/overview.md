# Overview

Before starting the installation, let's discover how OpenBAS is working, which dependencies are needed and what are the minimal requirements to deploy it in production.

## Architecture

The OpenBAS platform relies on several external databases and services in order to work.

### Platform

The platform is the central part of the OpenBAS platform, allowing users to configure scenarios, simulations, atomic testings and all other components used in the context of breach and attack simulations and security validations.

### Neutral agents / executors

Executors are embedded into the platform but you should configure at least one.
This system is responsible for executing local injectors on endpoints.

We developed a home-made XTM agent, and we support Caldera, Tanium and Crowdstrike. Others will be added in the near future.

      If you want to learn more about how to deploy executors, you can have more info [here](./ecosystem/executors.md).

### Injectors

Injectors are used to interact with third-party applications or services (including execution on the endpoints through executors) in the context of a simulation or an atomic testing. A few injectors are built-in but most of them are standalone Python processes.

### Collectors

Collectors are used to connect to all security systems such as SIEMs, XDRs, EDRs, firewalls, mail gateways etc. to check if an inject (execution, emails, etc.) has been detected or prevented and fill the security posture.

### Dependencies

| Component                 | Recommended version | CPU       | RAM          | Disk type                    | Disk space         |
|:--------------------------|:--------------------|:----------| :----------- | :--------------------------- |:-------------------|
| PostgreSQL                | ≥ 17.0              | 2 cores   | ≥ 8GB        | SSD                          | ≥ 16GB             |
| RabbitMQ                  | >= 4.0              | 1 core    | ≥ 512MB      | Standard                     | ≥ 2GB              |
| S3 / MinIO                | ≥ RELEASE.2023-02   | 1 core    | ≥ 128MB      | SSD                          | ≥ 16GB             |

Please note that while the versions of these dependencies are the recommended ones, OpenBAS may still function with earlier versions. However, we will not provide support for versions prior to the recommended ones.
