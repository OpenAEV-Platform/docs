# Taxonomies

Taxonomies in OpenBAS refer to the structured classification systems that help in organizing and categorizing platform
data. They are essential to the platform, enabling users to systematically tag and retrieve information based on
predefined categories and terms.

## Tags

Tags in OpenBAS serve as a powerful tool for organizing, categorizing, and prioritizing data.

Tags can be used to tag assets or teams with specific categories, making it easier to filter and search through large
datasets.

## Kill chain phases

Kill chain phases are used in OpenBAS to structure and analyze the data related to cyber threats and attacks. They
describe the stages of an attack from the perspective of the attacker and provide a framework for identifying, analysing
and responding to threats.

OpenBAS supports the following kill chain models:

- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework (Entreprise, PRE, Mobile and ICS)**

You can add, edit, or delete kill chain phases in the settings page, and assign them to attack patterns in the platform.
Additionally, you can filter data by kill chains phases, visualize relationships between kill chain phases and
injects, simulations or scenarios.

## Attack Patterns

Attack patterns are structured representations of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries to
compromise systems. In OpenBAS, attack patterns help analyze and classify threats, providing a standardized approach to
identifying and mitigating cyber risks.

OpenBAS supports the following attack pattern models:

- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework (Enterprise, PRE, Mobile, and ICS)**

You can add, edit, or delete attack patterns in the settings page and assign them to payloads or injectors.

## CVEs (EE)

CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) are standardized identifiers for publicly disclosed cybersecurity
vulnerabilities. Each CVE provides a unique reference, enabling consistent communication and tracking across tools and
teams.

In OpenBAS, CVEs are used to associate known vulnerabilities with assets, payloads, and injects. This allows users to
simulate attacks based on real-world flaws, enhancing the relevance and precision of security testing.

You can add, edit, or delete CVEs.
