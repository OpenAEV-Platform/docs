# User permissions ## What is RBACRole-Based Access Control (RBAC) is the way OpenAEV manages who can do what inside the platform.  Each user belongs to a group, and this group has one or more roles that define its **permissions**.Permissions determine what features a user can access.  If a user does not have the right permission, the option will simply not be available to them.In addition to general permissions (called *capabilities*), OpenAEV also supports **grants**. Grants are more precise: they allow access to a specific resource, such as one particular simulation, without giving the user access to all simulations.---## How to create a roleTo create a new role in OpenAEV:1. Go to **Settings → Security → Roles**.2. Click on **Create role**. Enter a **name** and an optional **description** for the role (e.g. "Platform role")   ![Create role](assets/create-role.png)3. Select the **capabilities** that should be included in this role, such as:    - Access assets    - Manage dashboards    - Delete documents    - ...      > **Note:** if you check a capability with **Delete**, the corresponding **Manage** and **Access** permissions will automatically be selected as well. This is because it is not possible to delete something without first being able to access and manage it.      ![Select capabilities](assets/select-capabilities.png)4. Save the role.> **Note:** If you want a user to automatically have all capabilities without restriction, you can enable the **Bypass** capability in their role.Once the role is created, it can be assigned to a **group**. All users in that group will automatically inherit the role’s permissions.---## How to assign a role to a userIn OpenAEV, roles are not assigned directly to users. Instead, they are linked through **groups**.1. Go to **Settings → Security → Groups**.2. Create a group. 3. In the group options, assign:   - One or more **roles** (defining the capabilities for this group).   - One or more **users** (who will inherit the group’s roles).   ![Select capabilities](assets/manage-group.png)---## Grants### How to grant a simulation to a userBeyond global **capabilities** defined in roles, OpenAEV also allows assigning more precise **grants**. Grants define permissions on specific resources (for example, one simulation), and they are always managed at the **group** level.**To grant a simulation to a user:**1. Go to **Settings → Security → Groups**.2. Click on **Manage grants** in the group options.3. A drawer will open with the available resources:      - Simulations      - Scenarios      - Atomic testings      - Payloads4. Select the specific items you want the group to access and assign the appropriate grant level.      ![Manage grants](assets/manage-grants.png)---### Special Cases- **Simulations, Scenarios, and Atomic Testing**   - A user can access these either through specific **grants**, or globally if the group has the **ASSESSMENT** capability (which overrides individual grants).- **Payloads**   - Access is given either through specific **grants**, or globally if the group has the **PAYLOAD** capability.---### Types of GrantsThere are three levels of granularity:| Grant   | Rights included                           ||---------|-------------------------------------------|| Access  | View only                                 || Manage  | View, edit, delete                        || Launch  | Manage rights + ability to launch tests   |---## Default Read AccessSome elements in OpenAEV are always visible to all users, regardless of their assigned capabilities or grants.  By default, the following features are open for everyone:- **Teams**- **Players**- **Taxonomies** (in the Settings)Users can view these elements without needing any specific capability, but additional rights are required if they want to manage them.---## Capability DependenciesIn some cases, performing an action in OpenAEV requires more than one capability.  If a required capability is missing, the action will be blocked and a warning message will explain which capability is missing.### Example- In **Scenarios**, when creating an article, the user also needs the capability to **access Channels**.- If the user does not have this capability, the article cannot be created.- A warning will be displayed, indicating that the necessary capability is missing.  ![Missing capability](assets/warning-missing-capabilities.png)This mechanism ensures consistency across the platform: actions that depend on other features cannot be performed without the proper access.
