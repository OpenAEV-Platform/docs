# Policies

## Overview

The Policies configuration page, located under **Settings > Security > Policies**, is designed to manage and customize various security-related settings. 
This page currently includes the configuration of _login messages_, with plans to expand its capabilities in the future.  

### Current Features

**Login Messages**   
Administrators can create and manage messages that are displayed to users upon login. This feature is useful for providing important information or updates directly to users when they access the platform.
  There are three types of messages:
  * **Platform Login Message**: Displayed above the login form to communicate vital information or announcements.
  * **Platform Consent Message**: Displayed to users during the login process. It appears as a notification that blocks access to the login form until users actively give their consent by checking an approval box. This ensures that users acknowledge and agree to certain terms or conditions before proceeding with logging in.
  * **Platform Consent Confirm Text**: A message accompanying the consent box, providing clarity on the consent confirmation process.

These messages can be customized to fit the organization's specific needs and requirements, ensuring that critical information is communicated effectively to users.
